# 👋 Welcome to Wyrdbound

We're exploring new ways to experience tabletop RPGs — solo or cooperatively — with AI-assisted game mastering.

## What is Wyrdbound?

**Wyrdbound** is a modular, text-based RPG game engine designed to run immersive tabletop-style adventures.  

It aims to support:

- Flexible rule definitions for various tabletop RPG systems (D&D, Pathfinder, etc)
- AI-powered Game Mastering using Large Language Models (LLMs) and narrative prompts
- Player-driven or emergent storytelling, with tools for both solo and multiplayer play
- Dynamic world and memory systems to track characters, choices, and consequences

> 📣 *This is an experimental project and currently under active development.*

### Why the name Wyrdbound?
After a few false starts and name ideas, we settled on Wyrdbound because it evokes a sense 
of mystery and layered meaning. "[Wyrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyrd)" comes from Old 
English, often translated as “fate” or “personal destiny.” The name suggests both being bound 
for adventure and bound like a book — a nod to storytelling and the strange, winding paths 
players might take.

We want every game to feel like a journey into the unexpected — a story unfolding through 
choice, chance, and curiosity.

## Goals

- Create a framework for encoding TTRPG rules in a way that can be reused, modified, and shared
- Enable rich, open-ended storytelling powered by language models
- Explore procedural generation, AI decision-making, and narrative structure in roleplaying games
- Make solo play approachable and engaging without the overhead of complex, manual steps
